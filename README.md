I got given a program recently from my Personal Trainer, a 2 week rotating exercise plan, and a nutrition plan.

Instead of tracking it in a boring excel file, I figured hey! I'm a developer... this is a great chance to make a project!

The end goal of this project will give you the flexibility to add/remove/edit workout days, exercises, sets and reps.

Likewise with nutrition, you'll be able to add/remove/edit foods.

The idea is to take data from inputs, and populate them into customizable lists.
